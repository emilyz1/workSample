# workSample
This is a repository featuring a couple projects I have worked on in the past!

# EduLecture.ai
EduLecture.ai is a website built using Node.js and React that transforms a Google Slides presentation uploaded by the user into a video lecture. To implement these features, we used Python, Google Developer APIs, Google Cloud Platform, Django, and Eleven Voice Lab APIs.

# 3D Minesweeper
3D Minesweeper is a Unity game built with C#. It aims to take the classic Minesweeper game and offer a unique twist of making the board 3D, where each cell instead is a cube, and the board is a cube of cubes. 

# Fraud Detection
Fraud Detection is a machine learning assignemnt from my Data Structures and Algorithms course, programmed in Java. The Clustering class takes locations from a given input file and clusters them based on proximity. The WeakLearner class implements a decision tree stump using a sweep line algorithm. The BoostingAlgorithm class takes the decision stump from WeakLearner and improves it by weighting locations based on accuracy.
